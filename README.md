# Pendulum_Simulation-
Pendulum Simulation using Python: Example of a system
What This exercise is about:
Desogning a model predictive controller for an invented pendulum system with an adjustable cart.

What you shoyld be able to do:
Design a model predictive for an inverted pendulum with an adjustable cart.
Demonstrate that the cart can perform a sequence of moves to maneuver from position y = -1.0 to y =0.0 within 6.2 seconds.
Introduction:
Design a model predictive controller for an inverted pendulum system with an adjustable cart. Demonstrate that the cart can perform a sequence of moves to maneuver from position y=-1.0 to y=0.0 within 6.2 seconds. Verify that v, θ, and q are zero before and after the maneuver
where u is the force applied to the cart, ε is m2/(m1+m2), y is the position of the cart, v is the velocity of the cart, θ is the angle of the pendulum relative to the cart, m1=10, m2=1, and q is the rate of angle change. Tune the controller to minimize the use of force applied to the cart either in the forward or reverse direction (i.e. minimize fuel consumed to perform the maneuver). 
Explain the tuning and the optimal solution with appropriate plots that demonstrate that the solution is optimal
